    <p>Hi! I'm Ziming, a 14-year-old high school student with a passion for teaching beginners how to code. I believe learning programming should be fun and relatable — and who better to teach you than someone close to your age?</p>

    <p>We’ll work on real projects in Scratch and Python, starting from zero. By the end, you’ll be confident writing your own simple games and scripts!</p>
